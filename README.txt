The idea of the robot is that when the player starts the game, those two plates 
in a picture start turning at increasing speed. The left plate has red piece of paper
in front and a blue one behind. The second plate has yellow in front and green behind. 
The buttons that can be seen in front of the robot also has pieces of paper with 
the responding colors. When the plate turns the player presses the right colored button. 
If the button was right he got 1 point and if it wasn't the game ends.
